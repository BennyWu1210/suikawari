# 🚶‍♂️🦮 **Suikawari: Walking Wingman for the Visually-Imparied** 🦮🚶‍♀️  

**What’s better than a map? A buddy.**   
Ever wished someone could walk with you and narrate your journey, telling you about obstacles, the closest taco stand, or what it feels like to be a superhero navigating with senses alone? Meet **StepMate**—the sassiest, most accessible walking assistant you'll ever need.

## 🧑‍🎤 **What is StepMate?**
StepMate is not your average tech gadget. It’s a live accessibility guru, powered by real-time video processing and some serious wizardry (a.k.a. AI and computer vision). Whether you're:  
- A visually impaired adventurer looking for a trusty sidekick.  
- A curious soul who wants to experience life through someone else’s lens.  
- Or just someone tired of tripping over their cat.  

StepMate’s got your back (and your front, and your sides).

## 🌀 **How Does It Work?**
1. **Live Video Magic** ✨: We process live video streams to detect objects, obstacles, and waypoints.  
2. **Audio-Visual Storytelling** 🎙️: Hear it straight in your ear—what’s ahead, what’s moving, and what might move (like that squirrel).  
3. **Experiential Mode** 🕶️: Curious about life without sight? Use StepMate to feel the world in a whole new way. It’s humbling, eye-opening, and hilariously awkward at first.

## 🎙️ **StepMate in Action!**  
Picture this: You’re walking down the street. Suddenly, StepMate chimes in:  
> “Yo, there’s a trash can 3 feet ahead. It’s not moving… yet. Go around it unless you *like* obstacles!”  

Or:  
> “Careful! A very ambitious pigeon is plotting something on your left. Move with caution.”  

StepMate keeps you informed, entertained, and most importantly, safe.
